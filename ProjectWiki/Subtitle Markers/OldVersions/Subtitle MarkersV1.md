# Subtitle markers

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_Accessibility/wiki)

Subtitle markers highlight the current word being said in the captions. Unique effects can also be applied, such as bouncing objects that bounce across to each word or letter.

Subtitle markers are a helpful improvement on knowing what is currently being said. They can also act as a fun feature. With normal subtitles, all of it is there at once, and if you are deaf or the volume is muted, you don't know what is being said at the current time. With the subtitle highlight marker, the current word/letter/number being said is highlighted.

With SNU Accessibility, settings can be changed to further customize captions and make them even more accessible.
