# WebVTT

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_Accessibility/wiki)

WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) is a W3 Standard subtitle/caption language for HTML5 video.

I am having difficulty importing WebVTT into the project at the moment. I have the subtitles listed out, but I can't get them to show up.

**This article on caption development is a stub. You can help by expanding it.**
